============================================

Spaghetti is an open-source Python library for the analysis of network-based spatial data. Originating from the `network` module in [PySAL (Python Spatial Analysis Library)](http://pysal.org), it is under active development for the inclusion of newly proposed methods for building graph-theoretic networks and the analysis of network events. This package is part of a [refactoring of PySAL](https://github.com/pysal/pysal/wiki/PEP-13:-Refactor-PySAL-Using-Submodules).

Installation
------------

As of version 1.4.2, `spaghetti` officially supports Python [3.6](https://docs.python.org/3.6/), [3.7](https://docs.python.org/3.7/), and [3.8](https://docs.python.org/3.8/). Please make sure that you are operating in a Python >= 3.6 environment.

**Installing with `conda` via [`conda-forge`](https://github.com/conda-forge/spaghetti-feedstock) (highly recommended)**

To install `spaghetti` and all its dependencies, we recommend using the [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
manager, specifically with the [`conda-forge`](https://conda-forge.org) channel. This can be obtained by installing the [`Anaconda Distribution`](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/) (a free Python distribution for data science), or through [`miniconda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (minimal distribution only containing Python and the conda package manager). 

Using `conda`, `spaghetti` can be installed as follows:
```
$ conda config --set channel_priority strict
$ conda install --channel conda-forge spaghetti
```

**Installing with [`PyPI`](https://pypi.org/project/spaghetti/)**
```
$ pip install spaghetti
```
*or* download the source distribution (`.tar.gz`) and decompress it to your selected destination. Open a command shell and navigate to the decompressed folder.
```
$ pip install .
```

***Warning***

When installing via `pip`, you have to ensure that the required dependencies for `spaghetti` are installed on your operating system. Details on how to install these packages are linked below. Using `conda` (above) avoids having to install the dependencies separately.

Install the most current development version of `spaghetti` by running:

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/pysal/spaghetti
```


Requirements
----------------
- [`esda`](https://esda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

- [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/devdocs/)
- [`rtree`](http://toblerity.org/rtree/install.html)
- [`scipy`](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/)

Soft Dependencies
----------------------
- [`geopandas`](http://geopandas.org/install.html)
